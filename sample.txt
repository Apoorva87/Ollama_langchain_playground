LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that are context-aware and reason about their responses.

Key features of LangChain include:
1. Modular Components: LangChain provides modular components that can be combined to create complex applications.
2. Chain of Thought: It supports complex reasoning by breaking down tasks into smaller steps.
3. Memory: LangChain includes memory components that allow for maintaining state across multiple interactions.
4. Document Processing: It can process and analyze documents, making it useful for question-answering systems.
5. Integration: LangChain can be integrated with various language models, including local models like Ollama.

Ollama is a tool that allows you to run large language models locally. It provides a simple way to use models like qwen3:8b on your own machine. When combined with LangChain, it creates a powerful system for building AI applications that can run entirely on your local hardware.

The combination of LangChain and Ollama enables developers to create sophisticated AI applications while maintaining privacy and reducing costs associated with cloud-based solutions.
